// It can be deleted if no other tool relies on it, or kept if planned for other uses.
// For now, to ensure no breakages if other parts (unseen by AI) might use it, 
// I will leave it empty but existent. Ideally, it should be removed if confirmed unused.

/**
 * @fileOverview This file is deprecated for Tool 1.
 * Tool 1 now uses BroadcastChannel API for inter-tab data communication.
 * This file can be removed if not used by other parts of the application.
